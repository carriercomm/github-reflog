GitHub Reflog v1.7.19
=====================

Welcome to the **The GitHub Reflog** â€” the chronicle of remarkable
GitHub repos and community activity. For previous editions, check out
`The Reflog Archive <https://github.com/kennethreitz/github-reflog>`_.

This week, we're extending a warm welcome to `The League of Moveable
Type <https://github.com/theleagueof>`_'s excellent open source fonts to
GitHub!

Featured Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`ryanmcgrath/wii-js <https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wii-js>`_
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Nintendo's ever-popular Wii console has a web browser, but little
development is done with it. This JavaScript project offers a stable,
robust, and documented API for wii/html interaction.

While not entirely practical for actual application development, this
project aims to be a great avenue for teaching kids about programming.

Wii-js supports up to four wiimotes interacting with a page at a time.
Check out the `demo page <http://venodesigns.net/wii/>`_ (on your wii)
to see it in action.

Awesome Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`danlucraft/git.js <https://github.com/danlucraft/git.js>`_
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is nothing short of awesome. A git implementation written in pure
JavaScript. Similar to the
`Dulwich <https://github.com/jelmer/dulwich>`_ project, for Python.

Git.js is MIT licensed. It features both a command-line git client for
node.js and an in-browser repo API for accessing repos available via
HTTP.
